## Inspiration
The inspiration for EventAR arose from the common challenges faced by event attendees navigating unfamiliar cities. Traditional maps and navigation tools often fall short in providing an immersive and customized experience. The idea was to leverage the capabilities of Unity's game engine and Google's Geospatial Creator API to create a cutting-edge augmented reality (AR) navigation tool, offering users a more engaging and reliable way to reach event venues.

## What it does
EventAR is an augmented reality-based navigational tool designed to guide event attendees through unfamiliar cities to their intended destinations. It uses real-world geographical coordinates to overlay AR markers, signs, and guidance systems throughout the city. The system not only provides general directions but also integrates with local transit systems, offering users a comprehensive and interactive navigation experience. The AR overlay offers spatial awareness, helping users stay on the right path and providing real-time feedback as they approach the event venue.

## How we built it

The development of EventAR involved harnessing the power of Unity's game engine, AR Core, and integrating the functionalities of Google's Geospatial Creator API. The process included creating a user-friendly interface, designing interactive markers, and implementing real-time updates. 

## What's next for EventAR
We envision several potential enhancements for EventAR. These include further customization options for users, additional features such as voice-guided navigation, collaboration with more event organizers, and continuous improvements based on user feedback. 
This is our first bout with Geospatial AR Application development and we are keen in further developing solutions in this promising field.
